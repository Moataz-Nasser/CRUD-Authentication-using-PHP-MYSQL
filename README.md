# Student Management Project
This is a student management website that uses base PHP for CRUD operations and user authentication, and uses MYSQL database for storage of data.

To try this project on your local machine, you need to import the database file called "project.sql" to your MYSQL RDBMS, and edit the "dbconfig.php' file.
You also need to make an admin account. There is no way to make one from the website, you need to open the database and add an account.

This project has many issues and can be improved in many ways from the DB design to the actual code, but i don't really care and i am only commiting it because i am learning git.
